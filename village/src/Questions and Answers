 Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

    Server-side routing is better optimized for search engines (only at the moment), every time we switch pages the whole page has to refresh just to recieve data, client-side routing eliminates this problem however it makes the inital loadup into the website slower.

 Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

    Create = Post, Read = Get, Update = Put, Delete = Delete

 Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.

    Axios, Fetch API, Request.
